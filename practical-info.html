<h2 id="the-language">The Language</h2>

<p>Being it the international wedding, we are inviting you to follow our lifestyle
and “meet in the midway”. In other words, we are keeping the international
standard of communication and organize the wedding in English.</p>

<p>We are aware of the fact that some guests from both parts are not comfortable
to speak or understand English, but we hope that you will still find a way to
enjoy our special day. Maybe offer a drink for your neighbour that he/she would
translate the parts you missed? <span class="e1a-wink e1a-med"></span></p>

<p>(Also, bring glasses if you have trouble reading from far as we will try that
most parts would be translated on the screen <span class="e1a-eyeglasses e1a-med"></span>)</p>

<p>For those that wish to make a toast and prefer to do it in their mother-tongue,
we kindly ask to prepare it beforehand that it could be translated for the
wedding. Please contact us and we will find a way to make it happen.
<span class="e1a-relaxed e1a-med"></span></p>

<h2 id="accommodation">Accommodation</h2>

<p>As it is common in Lithuania, though might be new to our overseas guests, we
celebrate wedding all night long and the day after! Therefore, most of the
wedding venues have places to sleep so that the next morning everyone can share
breakfast and good stories together.</p>

<p>On the other hand, it is also common that the main attention is given to
partying and sleeping is just a reward to your body after dancing all night.
<span class="e1a-sleeping e1a-med"></span></p>

<p>In other words, the rooms in the venue are shared with several guests and are
scattered throughout the area. While some of you will stay in the main house,
others will enjoy a more pillow party experience, sharing the floor in a
separate small house. While you may not expect a private en-suite, you can be
certain to have a place for a rest, no matter how long you’ll party! <span class="e1a-man_dancing e1a-med"></span></p>

<h2 id="dresscode">Dresscode</h2>

<p>The general dress code for the wedding is  <strong>black tie</strong> and the wedding colour is <strong>rose gold</strong>. While the particular dress code is discussed separately with our groomsmen and bridesmaids, we would appreciate other guests to wear even, pastel colour dresses and shirts, avoiding strong colours that doesn’t fit the palette.</p>

<p>It is important to notice, though, that the venue is in the nature, so steep
high heels should be avoided for your own convenience (there will be walking on
the grass and the entrance terrace is made of wooden floor with spaces).</p>

<p>In addition, as the overnight partying might suggest, it would be advisable to
have spare, more casual clothes for the second day. As all the girls know the
hell of putting  high heels the next morning after party, less requiring
clothes follow the same pattern. Thus, bring some  extra clothes and shoes!</p>

<h2 id="alternative-to-flowers">Alternative to Flowers</h2>

<p>While in Brazil gifts are usually already given prior to the wedding, in
Lithuania it is common to greet the newlyweds after the ceremony or before the
reception. While the expression “one cannot come empty-handed” is applied
everywhere, it is common to bring flowers to great the newlyweds.</p>

<p>As we already try to minimize the physical gifts, we would also like to ask to
save the flowers and leave them to blossom in the fields. Though the beauty of
them may, indeed, amaze us, we will not be able to enjoy them long as we cannot
bring them home by plane.</p>

<p>Alternatively, we would like to suggest bringing something that may really
enrich us for years to come. For those that wish to bring a physical gift, we
would suggest <strong>to choose a book for our yet small home library</strong>. No surprise
that Ricardo likes to read <span class="e1a-nerd e1a-med"></span>, but in these years around him even Egle grew interest
in that ancient way of learning!
<span class="e1a-book e1a-med"></span>
<span class="e1a-relaxed e1a-med"></span></p>

<p>The only thing we would like to ask is to choose a book that <strong>is written in
English</strong> so that we both can enjoy it!</p>

<h2 id="the-next-day">The Next Day</h2>

<p>After the breakfast and checking out of the rooms, we are planning to spend
some hours relaxing by the lake. If the weather allows, you can enjoy swimming
in the lake, rowing a boat or just laying around.</p>

<p>We will also organise some picnic food and barbeque so that we can all have
an unofficial, yet as pleasurable celebration time by the lake.</p>

<p>Thus, we invite you not to hurry home after breakfast and spend the day
relaxing.</p>

<p>Given that in the daylight nudity is not practised, don’t forget to bring your
swimsuit! <span class="e1a-bikini e1a-med"></span></p>
