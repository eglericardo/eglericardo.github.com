          <p>Lithuania and Brazil—two countries so far away from each other, so different,
so exotic in their own way. Here, we would like to make you a little acquainted
with the two countries we are from and the wedding traditions that distinguish
(or unite) us.</p>

<h2 id="-lithuania"><span class="e1a-flag_lt e1a-lg"></span> Lithuania</h2>
<p>Lithuania is a small but proud country in the geographical center of Europe. As
there are not many Lithuanians in the world (approximately three million), they
live surrounded by forests and lakes and always feel connection with the nature
(like a tribe in Amazonia?<span class="e1a-stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes e1a-med"></span>).</p>

<p>Maybe due to connection to the nature, Lithuanians have also kept their ancient
traditions, including pagan rituals and the Lithuanian language.</p>

song</a> to listen (also
recommended for Lithuanians!).</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="-brazil"><span class="e1a-flag_br e1a-lg"></span> Brazil</h2>
<p>Brazil is unique in several ways: it is the fifth largest country in the world,
1.65× larger than Europe, but it is only 518 years old; its population is
composed of native-americans, descendants of africans, europeans (even
Lithuanians!) and asians; it hosts several natural wonders such as Amazon
Forest, Pantanal, Iguaçu Falls, Lençóis Maranhenses; it has 7.500 km of
coastline and so many and diverse cultures that it is impossible to talk about
Brazil as a whole—it is more like a continent! (Still, we officially speak a
single language, Brazilian Portuguese, not Spanish!)</p>

<h2 id="-wedding-traditions-"><span class="e1a-bride_with_veil_tone2 e1a-lg"></span> Wedding Traditions <span class="e1a-man_in_tuxedo_tone1 e1a-lg"></span></h2>

<p>Although weddings have many common traditions around the world, we’d like to
mention several traditions that are special for the countries of Lithuania and
Brazil.</p>

<h3 id="lithuanian-wedding">Lithuanian Wedding</h3>
<p>Lithuania have deep historical and cultural roots. The wedding is no exception:
mixed with paganism and christianity, Lithuanian weddings used to follow a list
of rituals and even challenges that needs to be overcome to ensure a happy
marriage. You can read a little about the traditional way of celebrating
Lithuanian weddings
<a href="http://www.draugas.org/news/customs-traditions-the-lithuanian-wedding-a-family-celebration/">here</a>
and
<a href="https://comeniusita10.blogspot.nl/2012/05/traditional-lithuanian-wedding.html">here</a>
(in English), or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeY7ijiHROA">watch a little introduction
video</a>. Also, you can also watch
how <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYUJYGUOJWw">weddings with pagan traditions looks like</a>.</p>

<p>Although there are some couples that still follow the traditional routine,
nowadays weddings are more modern and include just some parts of ancient
traditions. Let’s mention some of them (that you may encounter during our
wedding):</p>

<dl>
<dt>Greet the newlyweds with water, bread and salt</dt>
<dd>From old times bread symbolizes material wealth and well-being. When
parents greet the newlyweds with bread, they are wishing that their new home
would always have bread, and thus would not lack material virtues.  <span class="e1a-moneybag e1a-med"></span> Salt for centuries
was a symbol of longevity - salt do not stall and make other food stay fresh.
Thus, giving salt, parents are wishing their love to be long-lasting and that
the newlyweds would have a long and healthy life.  <span class="e1a-muscle_tone1 e1a-med"></span> Water, finally, symbolizes
life, new beginning, as water is a foreground of every life-being. Giving water
parents are greeting with a new family life and are wishing it to get bigger
soon.  <span class="e1a-baby_tone1 e1a-med"></span>  <span class="e1a-fearful e1a-med"></span>
</dd>

<dt>Family fire</dt>
<dd>The ceremony of transferring family fire is an ancient pagan
tradition when fire had a strong symbolic meaning. It symbolized home
well-being, warmth and safety, thus every home should always have a sacred fire
burning. During the wedding, parents are sharing their home fire and giving it
for the new family, new home. 
</dd>

<dt>Amber ceremony</dt>
<dd>Again, amber ceremony involves fire as inseparable part of life.
Ancient lithuanians had seen fire as an invisible living-being, not just as a
process of burning.  Amber, on the other hand, was seen as a magical substance.
It is said that amber is a talisman of happiness, health and love, so it
guarantees happy marriage.  <span class="e1a-couple_with_heart e1a-med"></span>
</dd>

<dt>Something old, something new, something blue, something borrowed and a silver
coin</dt>
<dd>
It is quite common that a bride would have something old, something new,
something blue, something borrowed on her dress, and a silver coin in her shoe.
It is said that something old symbolizes connection with her family and
relatives. Something new - is a symbol of a new beginning, new family.
Something blue stands for faithfulness, whereas the coin in a shoe is an
assurance that the new family would never lack resources. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="brazilian-wedding">Brazilian Wedding</h3>

<p>Brazilian wedding traditions are not as old as Lithuanian ones, but they are
good representatives of the countries’ history, joyful temperament and
superstition.</p>

<p>Most, if not all, of those traditions have origins in the rural or workers
social circles, but they are omnipresent in the Brazilian weddings.</p>

<p>In case you are interest in reading more about it,
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/30fic5/brazils_wedding_traditions/">here</a>
and
<a href="http://www.weddedwonderland.com/6-brazilian-wedding-traditions-you-didnt-know-about/">here</a>
are good references.</p>

<p>In our wedding, you may encounter some of those traditions:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Table of Brazilian sweets</dt>
<dd>
Brazilians are known to be sweet-teeth, probably because of the country’s
history around sugarcane trade and the great quantity of different sweets’
recipes. For this reason, the sweets’ table is very special in Brazilian
weddings, not only because of the amount of sweets, but also because of their
particular decoration style. It is an unique and delicious tradition they are
proud of! <span class="e1a-candy e1a-med"></span>
</dd>

<dt>Give “bem-casado” sweet to people</dt>
<dd>
“Bem-casado”, which could be translated as “well-married”, is a traditional
Brazilian candy served (almost) exclusively at wedding occasions. The way it is
made symbolizes the union of two people with a good layer of complicity and
respect. It is said the every person who tastes it gives a special bless to the
newlyweds marriage. So taste it! <span class="e1a-yum e1a-med"></span>
</dd>

<dt>Bride's shoe and groom's tie auction</dt>
<dd>
That’s a quite recent tradition that come as a support for the honeymoon:
during the wedding reception, a single shoe of the bride is placed in the
middle of the dancing floor (or goes table by table) and the guests, at will,
collaborate (chip-in) with some cash supposedly to support the newlyweds
honeymoon costs—all organized by the bridesmaids. <span class="e1a-high_heel e1a-med"></span>

In the case of the groom’s tie, the guests “buy” pieces of
the tie of the groom (yes, sometimes they cut-out pieces of the tie <span class="e1a-grimacing e1a-med"></span>), which is
actioned by the groomsmen among the guests, also to collaborate with the
honeymoon’s costs.
</dd>

<dt>Write the names of single friends in the dress hem</dt>
<dd>
It is a tradition that it is said to have started as a joke: to have the name
written in the bride’s hem increases the chance to find a good husband. <span class="e1a-smirk e1a-med"></span> And the
names are in the inside part of the dress because Brazilian women don’t want to
look desperate for husbands.
</dd>

<dt>Tame the donkey</dt>
<dd>
The equivalent to chopping wood in Lithuania's traditions, that’s an old
tradition from some rural areas of Brazil. The groom should tame a donkey,
essential animal for farm work, but also very stubborn, to prove its manhood
and suitability to be a responsible husband and provider.  For obvious reasons,
it is an outdated tradition, changed by extensive interrogations to the groom,
performed by the parents-in-law to-be, about his work stability. <span class="e1a-sweat_smile e1a-med"></span>
