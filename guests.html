          <p>To this small, but very precious and personal wedding, we are inviting those
that are deep in our hearts. The closeness between family and relatives is
obvious, thus here we would like to mention our dear friends—bridesmaids and
groomsmen.</p>

<h2 id="bridesmaids">Bridesmaids</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Milda</dt>
<dd>
It is said that university is the last time to make friends for life. And
I was lucky: me and Milda met during the first semester of our Psychology
studies, when we sat together in the English class. Milda was a shy girl that
came to the big city for studies. But that changed very fast and she became a
super active, enthusiastic (not about studies, though <span class="e1a-sweat_smile e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>) person. My friendship
with her not only included group works and university related activities, much
more we bonded through clubbing, travelling and open conversations. Till now,
she always lights up my day with her messages, travelling pictures and those
unexpected calls at my birthday, no matter where I am. 

She has a special role in our wedding (as a witness) because she is the reason
me and Ricardo met. If not her active search for hosts during our holidays in
Italy and her insistence to stay in Verona that cold day of February, I might
have never met the person that changed my life. Coincidence, intuition? I
don’t know. But friendship, definitely, is there in the equation!<span class="e1a-hugging e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>
</dd>
 
<dt>Agnė</dt>
<dd>
Just before the university, my high-school was also a place where I found
very dear friends. One of them is, of course, Agnė. Together we had many days
of talking about life, many nights of partying and many head massages during
the classes <span class="e1a-person_getting_massage_tone2 e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>. She is the person without complexes, the person that can
dance and laugh at any time in any place. With her, I always felt a special
vibe, a freedom to show my feminine side that I couldn’t do with anyone else.
Although time is changing us, the memories and friendship bond always stays the
same! 
</dd>

<dt>Ilona</dt>
<dd>
Some people you meet, some people just walk into your life. Ilona was my
mentor, my sister. With her I learned about beauty, about cooking, about life.
She was the person that I told every smallest detail of my day, watch 2-3 Sex &amp;
the City episodes daily and talk for hours. Not because we are both blondies
or because we are born one day apart, it’s the similar mindset (<span class="e1a-tropical_drink e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>), even sometimes
mind-reading that made us feel so close. The time and distance made us go our
own ways, but I will always cherish the bond that we have, doesn’t matter how
often we can watch the series again together! 
</dd>

<dt>Justė and Rūta</dt>
<dd>
Finally, I have two friends that cannot be described separately. Rūta and Justė
became part of my life since the time I remember <span class="e1a-baby_tone2 e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>. They were the people that I
grew up with, spend hours every day playing, raising puppies, creating songs
and much more. Together we passed through childhood, discovered teenage years
and had a LOT of adventures <span class="e1a-shushing_face e1a-med-no-spaces"></span>. I always was a bit resistant about some crazy
ideas they had, but I have never regretted being convinced to go. With them I
developed myself, lived through heart-aches and enjoyed exploring the world.
Though we are all living now our lives, we still keep ourselves updated and
continue this long-lasting friendship. 
</dd>
</dl>

<h2 id="groomsmen">Groomsmen</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Pedro (a.k.a. Ruminante)</dt>
<dd>
Pedro is my oldest friend among the groomsmen. My first memory of him is in a
(sick) faculty competition, which is better left in the past… For both of our
good reputations! But after we met, soon we became good friends and shared
several nights of studies, drinking, gaming, fooling around, cheap pizzas,
funny dramas (“I won’t be no one… I’m going to work for a blockbuster in
Sorocaba!”) and so, so many stories that bounded our friendship and nurtured my
respect for such genius and honourable person!

Oh! He is also the first person from my inner circle to meet Eglė (and Milda)
and has been, here in Europe, an invaluable piece of my past, present and,
hopefully, future!
</dd>

<dt>Ricardo (a.k.a. Fadinha)</dt>
<dd>
Ricardo is my stunt among the groomsmen. My first memory of him is in a Saint
John’s party where he “got sick” and ended up in hospital. I met him because of
Pedro, by the way. And although I have the memory–impression that I didn’t like
him at first, we became good friends pretty soon (don’t ask me how, maybe
during our shared activity as students’ representatives) to the point people
couldn’t recognize which Ricardo was which.  He is also the guy that used to
bring my extremes to the world, for good or for bad; together, drunk, we
invaded restaurants kitchens, went to parties and met psychotic people, but
also he is the one I exchange confidences as little teenager girls do when
things are difficult.

Oh! He was also the bet that would marry first among all of us… And he did!
</dd>

<dt>Gabriel (a.k.a. Resende)</dt>
<dd>
Gabriel is, in personality terms, maybe the most similar one to myself. (But I
am the most beautiful one!) I actually don’t remember my first memory of him,
but I remember his first noble act towards me: he has recommended me to an
internship that I wanted so much! From that, he suddenly became such a good
friend that is difficult to talk about my adulthood without citing his name.

Alongside Gabriel, I have reached my bottom (sleeping in the street, more than
once!) and my top achievements and I have defined the “gentleman” I am today:
all the paradoxical philosophies, the crazy traditions, the choleric
expressions, the strong values and omnipresent responsibility.

To me, he is also kind of the glue of the group and the first Daddy among us!
(Wish you the best, little Resende’s girl!)
</dd>

<dt>Geovandro (a.k.a. Géovs)</dt>
<dd>
Geovandro is the youngest friend of the groomsmen, which means I “just” know
him for about 12 years. My first memory of him is in a study group at my
student home, which has finished, of course, in beers and inappropriate
conversation. To me, he is the the random element of the group, the one humble
and balanced person that, at the power of Jägermeister or Maria-Mole, brings
the Wonderland to our lives!

He is also the most cryptic of the group (maybe because of his job?) and along
the jokes and fun, he has helped to look further (or around, depending on the
badger of the situation) and give me courage to pursue my goals.

And, of course… He is the free spirit of the group, in his own unique way!
